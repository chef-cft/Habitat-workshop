                                    When running an application you need a subsystem to monitor the underlying processes. 
                                    The subsystem is responsible for ensuring required services are available before an application starts, or when it's reconfigured. 
                                    In many modern architectures some amount of responsibility for the resilience of an application depends on a developer coding with an unreliable service backend in mind, instead of focusing on application functionality and features.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When these responsibilities are given over to the Habitat Supervisor, it can perform pre-defined environment readiness checks, sequencing, service discovery, deployment pattern execution, real-time reporting and even roll-backs. 
                                    The Supervisor is a light-weight agent built to handle all these runtime operations. 
                                    By declaring the runtime responsibilities during the application definition phase, you know exactly how an application will be managed by the Supervisor during its runtime.
