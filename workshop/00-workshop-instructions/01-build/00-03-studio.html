                                    Habitat Studio is a development kit for creating automated build and deployment plans. 
                                    Studio is where packages are defined, packaged, and tested. 
                                    As a clean-room environment it contains only the minimal number of system dependencies needed to build an application. 
                                    It's essentially an empty environment, which requires application developers to declare exactly what build and runtime dependencies are needed for your application to function correctly.

                                    The power of building in a cleanroom is ensuring that packages are built consistently and completely, and will run correctly wherever they're deployed. 
                                    This eliminates the discrepancies between test and production environment runtimes.
