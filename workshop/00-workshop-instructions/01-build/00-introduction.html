                                    Your edge devices likely have more than one application, deployed to more than one type of device (that you maintain). 
                                    Often these applications use different languages, frameworks, and deployment patterns that can lead to confusion when on-boarding team members, 
                                    standardizing workflows and practices, or automating deployment and management procedures. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tha means building, deploying and managing each application becomes a specialized process, requiring the maintainers to be intimately familiar with how 
                                    that application works and the environment it will run in.
                                </p>                                
                                <p>
                                    Instead of designing an application to run in a specialized environment, application deployments should be flexible and able to adapt to changes in runtime requirements. 
                                    Standardizing the process of packaging, deploying and managing an application gives IT operators a workflow that is common to all application deployments, and simplifies the process for delivering value quickly.

                                    Progress Chef Edge Management solution accomplishes this by providing an ecosystem for the consistent and reliable packaging, deployment and management of an application 
                                    throughout its lifecycle.
