                                    Application delivery requirements and dependencies are defined in code, and then versioned and packaged alongside the application into a single artifact. 
                                    This common release library publishes the deployment instructions with the application code, providing a common release library to ensure build consistency 
                                    across environments.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The published Habitat Artifacts are immutable, and stored in a single-origin that cannot be accessed by humans. 
                                    This ensures consistency and trust in the build pipeline, because you can rely on the built artifacts behaving the same way 
                                    in a production scenario that they do in development. This reduction in deployment friction enables your team to focus on providing value, 
                                    instead of grooming each application according to its specific needs and requirements. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And the best part? No changes to the application code are needed to build, package, and deploy with Habitat.
                                    All the data required to build and package your application is contained in the <b>Habitat Plan.</b>
