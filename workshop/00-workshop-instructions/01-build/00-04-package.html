                                    Habitat Artifacts are signed, immutable objects that are built in a clean-room environment called the Studio. 
                                    A .HART artifact is the final product of packaging the application and its automation instructions into a single binary file that can be deployed in 
                                    any environment supported by the Habitat ecosystem.

                                    This methodology eliminates the need for build engineers to create and maintain unique worker nodes for continuous integration servers. 
                                    Instead, all direct and indirect application dependencies are defined in an artifact, and the resulting .HART file describes everything needed to build the application. 
                                    This includes dependency management, runtime environment binaries, and application lifecycle hooks.
